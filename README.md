# Chi Cerca Trova

> Who search, will find

A smallish demo to try out ncurses.  A board 80x24 is created and
filled randomly with treasures, initially hidden.  The user can
search for the treasures around him.

The player is represented by a `@`.  The keys are the usual `hjkl`
to move, `s` to search, `c` to enable the cheats and `q` to quit.

It may or may not respond well to resizes.
